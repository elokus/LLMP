## **Features**

- **High-Level Abstractions**: Effortlessly create, store, and optimize prompts, enabling smoother integrations into software applications.

- **Structured Outputs**: By leveraging the YAML format, LLMP achieves reduced token usage and structures that resonate with large language models.

- **Efficient Initialization**: The Program class in LLMP transforms the way tasks are initiated. By naming a job and outlining input/output models, tasks are set up swiftly.

- **StructGenie Integration**: A synergy with StructGenie ensures robust type validation and the ability to incorporate intricate rules into the output model.

- **Management & Optimization System**: Beyond prompt creation, LLMP excels with features like performance logging, structured storage, and prompt/job optimization.

- **Type Validation**: Assures dependable structured outputs while minimizing the need for additional LLM calls.

- **Incorporation of Advanced Rules**: Adaptability is key. From multiple-choice queries to loops, LLMP's tasks can accommodate diverse needs.

- **Ongoing Development**: The LLMP framework is under continuous improvement, aligning with the ever-evolving domain of generative NLP.
