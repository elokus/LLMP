Welcome to LLMP's documentation!
==================================
LLMP, or Large Language Model Programming, is a Python framework designed to simplify the use of generative NLP tasks. It offers high-level abstractions to create, store, and optimize prompts for jobs that can be used in software applications.

The primary objective of LLMP is to allow developers to utilize large language models in their applications without the need to manually craft and optimize prompts.

Background: StructGenie
========================

StructGenie is the underlying engine for LLMP. It provides a template system to define generation tasks, including input schema, desired output structures, and relevant examples.
